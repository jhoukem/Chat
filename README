Simple client/server chat application in C.
Clone this repository, cd into it and then type "make".
If you haven't ncurses installed already, do so by typing: "sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev" and relaunch the make.
After the sources are compiled, launch the client as follow:
./client [server_address] [port]
There is a bug with the get_input function, sometimes the output is messed up.
